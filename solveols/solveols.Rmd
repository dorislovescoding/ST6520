## Solve for linear Equation (solveols)

Here the objective function is $Ax=b$ and we would like to solve for x using Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi or Parellel Jacobi. The function is in the following form:

`solveols(A, b, iter, type ='GS', c=1)`

Here A needs to be invertible.

Type can be defined as "GS" or "Jacobi"

The variable `c` determines the number of cores to be used in the parallel realization of Jacobi methods and the default is 1.

Here we need to make sure that Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi converge. Otherwise, after many iternation it would show the maximum number written in the code.
